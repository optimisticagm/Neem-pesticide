# Neem Oil Extraction Simulation using Aspen Plus
## Project Overview
Simulation of neem (Azadirachta indica) oil extraction (used as pesticide) and separation using Aspen Plus.

## Objectives
- Model neem oil extraction process
- Analyze material balance
- Evaluate separation efficiency

## Methodology
- Property method: SOLID
- Stream Class: MIXIPSD
- Unit operations: Mixer/ Decanter/ Pumps/ Valves/ Extractor / Separator / Distillation
- Feed: Neem seed and leaves / neem oil mixture (assuming the particles PSD aligns with simulation)

## Results
- Key stream compositions and flowrates are provided in:
  Neem_Results.xlsx
- Energy duties and separation performance analyzed

## Files in this Repository
- NEEM_Simulation.bkp – Aspen Plus simulation file
- NEEM_Results.xlsx – Exported Aspen result tables
- Images/ – Flowsheet and result screenshots

⚠️ Aspen Plus software is required to open the simulation file.


✅ STEP 2: Upload Screenshots (Very Important)
